                <p class="bio">ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤI am a quick learner and comfortable in adapting new technologies and environment, I am a tech geek and passionate about technologies and programing.
                    I do program in JAVA and my work follows DevOps Culture. I am an Open-Source enthusiast and I follow agile practices in software development.
                    I am an tech geek currently working on Cloud Computing and DevOps.
                    I believe DevOps is not just about Tools and platforms but also about Culture. I strongly believe in the ethics and communitcation systems in organisation which makes me more curious to know about organisation's working and project's demand.
                <br><br>Also throughout my career I have been in many tech communities where I have grown my connections amnong developers, HRs and tech enthusiasts. Over the time, I have experienced that projects enchances as much as it get reviewd and new ideas are added to it. This has intrigued me more towards Open-Source.</p>
